I was asked to write a post for an external site! It's available [here](https://owlskip.com/s/FP).

t takes a while to develop "taste" in programming, to figure what you think works well and what doesn't. Your taste and another excellent engineer's taste might be different, and result in different tradeoffs, but I find it useful and interesting to write down what I think (so far!). This is how I think about Functional Programming in Python.
