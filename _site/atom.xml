&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my blog! I was going to get right down to business, but this felt like a good time to set out what exactly
I aim to accomplish by writing things publically available on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is primarily a “technical” blog. I certainly love writing witty one-liners, posting about my personal life, or taking pictures of myself eating things - but I have twitter, facebook, and a silly tumblr that you’ll just have to inquire after the password to for all of those respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goals:
1. To keep a record of stuff that I’ve learned recently for reinforcement and future reference.
2. To be useful to others looking for resources. For right now that will be a lot of systems and command-line utility orieted things, hopefully accessible to those who (like me) don’t have a computer architecture course under their belts. 
3. To give myself a reason to go in depth into topics that I don’t have to do expictly for work, like for example, learning how to set up a Jekyll-based blog.&lt;/p&gt;
