My name is Amandine.

I work on reliability at Dropbox. Previously, I was a software engineer on databases, developer tooling and delivery for desktop, and on the desktop client itself. I like making things more functional: better abstracted code, more reliable systems, and processes that add more value. 

I studied physics, statistics, and a lot of other topics at Swarthmore College. [Recurse Center](www.recurse.com) was really key to my transition into tech. 

I'm interested in the rules by which complex systems run and their emergent properties. This applies to both computers and people.

In my spare time, I try to spend a lot of time outside exercising and inside crafting.
