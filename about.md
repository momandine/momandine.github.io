My name is Amandine.

I work as a software engineer, currently on release engineering. 

I studied physics, statistics, and a lot of other topics at Swarthmore College. [Recurse Center](www.recurse.com) was really key to my transition into tech. 

I'm interested in the rules by which complex systems run and their emergent properties. This applies to both computers and people.

In my spare time, I try to spend a lot of time outside exercizing and inside crafting.
