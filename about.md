My name is Amandine. Here is my [resume]({{ site.url }}/assets/Resume20141223.pdf).

I work as a software engineer, though I was trained at Swarthmore College in the liberal sciences of physics and statistics. [Hacker School](www.hackerschool.com) was really key in this transition. 

Recently, I've been trying to learn a lot about distributed systems, Linux administration and databases. I also think that effective communication is really important. 

In my spare time, I teach Intro to CS via [TEALS](www.tealsk13.org), go rock climbing, take ballet classes, run moderate distances at a moderate pace, listen to almost embarassing amounts of music, and cook things.
