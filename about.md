My name is Amandine. 

I work as a software engineer, though I was trained at a small college in the liberal sciences of physics and statistics. [Hacker School](www.hackerschool.com) was really key in this transition. 

Recently, I've been trying to learn a lot about distributed systems and databases. I also think that effective communication is really important. 

Other things I do:

* Teach Intro to CS via [TEALS](www.tealsk13.org)
* Go rock climbing
* Take ballet classes
* Run moderate distances at a moderate pace
* Listen to almost embarassing amounts of music
* Cook things
