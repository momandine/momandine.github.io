My name is Amandine.

I work on databases at Dropbox. Previously, I worked on developer tooling and delivery for desktop, and on the desktop client itself. I'm a software engineer with a strong interest in reliability and automation.

I studied physics, statistics, and a lot of other topics at Swarthmore College. [Recurse Center](www.recurse.com) was really key to my transition into tech. 

I'm interested in the rules by which complex systems run and their emergent properties. This applies to both computers and people.

In my spare time, I try to spend a lot of time outside exercizing and inside crafting.
